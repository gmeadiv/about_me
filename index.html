          <ol class="topTenFolkSongs">
            <li>10. Thirty - The Weather Station</li>
              <!-- <dd>This song helped me turn 30. She drops an f-bomb out of nowhere and it forces you to listen to the song a second time to figure out why.</dd> -->
            <li>9. Home Again - Adam Carroll</li>
              <!-- <dd>Do you like the story of Odysseus? Adam Carroll tells it better than the Coen Brothers. He's the first, but not the last, Texan on this list.</dd> -->
            <li>8. Casey Jones - The Grateful Dead</li>
              <!-- <dd>Driving that train, high on cocaine! Casey Jones, you better watch your speed...</dd> -->
            <li>7. The Internationale - Alistair Hulett</li>
              <!-- <dd>It's the age of COVID. It's the age of protest. As folk protest songs go, this is one of the most fun. The Irish sure know how to write revolutionary anthems.</dd> -->
            <li>6. Look at Miss Ohio - Gillian Welch</li>
              <!-- <dd>Gillian Welch is one of my favorite songwriters of all time and this is one of her best. Another great driving song.</dd> -->
            <li>5. October - Jackson C. Frank</li>
              <!-- <dd>Jackson C. Frank has one of the most tragic histories of any folk singer. This song is haunting. One of those you don't really need to understand, in order to <em>understand.</em></dd> -->
            <li>4. Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts - Bob Dylan</li>
              <!-- <dd>Bob Dylan belongs on every top ten list of folk songs, but which song!? This is my favorite, a story of mystery and revenge. Also a song my dad would play on roadtrips.</dd> -->
            <li>3. Cover Me Up - Jason Isbell</li>
              <!-- <dd>Jason Isbell may be as close as any generation may come to having their own Bob Dylan. This album, Southeastern Son, is one of the rare ones you can listen to all the way through and never have to skip a song.</dd> -->
            <li>2. Dead Flowers - Townes Van Zandt</li>
              <!-- <dd>The second Texan on my list. Townes might be one of the coolest songwriters ever and this is his most beautiful song. This is actually a cover of a Rolling Stones song. Also, it's in one of the greatest movies of all time: The Big Lebowski.</dd> -->
            <li>1. 1952 Vincent Black Lightning - Richard Thompson</li>
              <!-- <dd>One of my favorite stories ever. An English song about a boy, a girl, a motorcycle, and armed robbery. With some technical, but still pretty sounding, guitar playing for a background.</dd> -->
